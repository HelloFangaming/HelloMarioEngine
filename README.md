# Hello Mario Engine

The **Hello Mario Engine** is an open source Mario engine for **GameMaker: Studio** that is feature packed, and designed to be easy to expand upon with user friendliness as a priority. The engine is fully documented with thousands of code comments, and includes tons of different powerups, over a hundred different enemies, and much, much more!

The engine is open source, and is licensed under the **New BSD License**. This license gives you permission to make *whatever you want* with my engine, with no restrictions whatsoever. It also requires that you give credit for use of my engine. Please give credit to **Hello Fangaming** for use of the **Hello Mario Engine**. Thank you.

Before importing the **Hello Mario Engine**, make sure that you are using GameMaker: Studio v1.4.9999. Otherwise, things will not work properly. If you are using the free version of GameMaker: Studio, make sure you upgrade it to the Standard version before importing.

The **Hello Mario Engine** is discontinued. Support will no longer be provided for this engine. Anyone is free to fork the engine and continue it in my place.
